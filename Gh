Okay, let's break down how you can use the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of your LLM's accuracy scores to define four threshold ranges: Overconfident, Okay (Green), Concern (Yellow), and Not Okay (Red).

This approach assumes you have a collection of accuracy scores from evaluating your LLM on various tasks, datasets, or different runs. The mean tells you the average performance, and the standard deviation tells you how spread out those performances typically are.

Steps:

Gather Your Data:

Collect a representative set of accuracy scores for your LLM. This could be accuracy percentages (0-100) or decimals (0-1) from multiple evaluation runs, different test sets, or different specific tasks the LLM performs.

Let's say your accuracy scores are: A = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}.

Calculate Mean (μ) and Standard Deviation (σ):

Mean (μ): Calculate the average of all your accuracy scores.
μ = (a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n) / n

Standard Deviation (σ): Calculate the standard deviation of the scores. This measures the typical amount of variation or dispersion from the mean.
σ = sqrt( Σ(a_i - μ)² / (n-1) ) (Use n instead of n-1 if you have a very large population, but n-1 is standard for samples). Most spreadsheet or programming tools have built-in functions (like STDEV.S in Excel or numpy.std in Python with ddof=1).

Define Thresholds based on μ and σ:
The core idea is to use multiples of the standard deviation away from the mean to set your boundaries. Here's a common way to set up the four zones. Note: The specific multiples (e.g., 0.5σ, 1σ, 1.5σ) are adjustable based on your specific needs and risk tolerance.

Red Zone (Not Okay): Performance is significantly below average.

Threshold: Accuracy < μ - 1.5σ

Interpretation: Scores in this range are unusually low compared to the typical performance variation. This indicates a serious problem with the model's accuracy on that specific evaluation.

Yellow Zone (Concern): Performance is below average, but not drastically so.

Threshold: μ - 1.5σ <= Accuracy < μ - 0.5σ

Interpretation: Scores here are lower than average but within a range that might occur occasionally due to normal variation. However, it warrants attention and investigation, especially if it happens frequently.

Green Zone (Okay): Performance is around the average, including slightly above average.

Threshold: μ - 0.5σ <= Accuracy <= μ + 1σ

Interpretation: This is the expected range of performance. Scores here are considered normal or good. Falling within this range suggests the model is performing as expected based on its historical data.

Overconfident Zone: Performance is significantly above average.

Threshold: Accuracy > μ + 1σ

Interpretation: While high accuracy is generally good, scores much higher than the typical variation might indicate:

Genuine Excellence: The model performed exceptionally well.

Overfitting: The model might be too closely tuned to the specific test data, and may not generalize well.

Easy Task/Data Leakage: The evaluation task/data might have been too simple or contained information inadvertently leaked from the training data.

Data Anomaly: The specific test set might be an outlier.
This zone doesn't necessarily mean "bad" like the Red Zone, but it suggests the result is unusual compared to the norm and might warrant investigation to understand why it's so high. You might adjust the upper boundary (e.g., μ + 1.5σ or μ + 2σ) if you only want to flag truly exceptional outliers as potentially "Overconfident" or suspicious.

Summary Table:

Category	Color	Threshold Range	Interpretation
Not Okay	Red	Accuracy < μ - 1.5σ	Significantly below average; likely problematic.
Concern	Yellow	μ - 1.5σ <= Accuracy < μ - 0.5σ	Below average; warrants attention/investigation.
Okay	Green	μ - 0.5σ <= Accuracy <= μ + 1σ	Within the expected range of performance.
Overconfident*	(Blue?)	Accuracy > μ + 1σ	Unusually high; potentially good, but investigate why.

(You can choose a different color, like Blue or Purple, for "Overconfident" as it doesn't carry the same negative connotation as Red/Yellow)

Example:

Suppose you evaluated your LLM 10 times and got these accuracy scores (as percentages):
{85, 88, 82, 90, 78, 86, 89, 75, 81, 86}

Calculate μ:
μ = (85+88+82+90+78+86+89+75+81+86) / 10 = 840 / 10 = 84

Calculate σ:
Using a calculator or software, σ ≈ 4.69 (using n-1 denominator)

Calculate Threshold Boundaries:

μ - 1.5σ ≈ 84 - 1.5 * 4.69 = 84 - 7.04 = 76.96

μ - 0.5σ ≈ 84 - 0.5 * 4.69 = 84 - 2.35 = 81.65

μ + 1σ ≈ 84 + 1 * 4.69 = 84 + 4.69 = 88.69

Define Ranges:

Red: Accuracy < 76.96

Yellow: 76.96 <= Accuracy < 81.65

Green: 81.65 <= Accuracy <= 88.69

Overconfident: Accuracy > 88.69

Applying to New Scores:

If you get a new score of 75: It falls in the Red zone (Not Okay).

If you get a new score of 80: It falls in the Yellow zone (Concern).

If you get a new score of 85: It falls in the Green zone (Okay).

If you get a new score of 91: It falls in the Overconfident zone (Investigate why it's unusually high).

Important Considerations:

Data Quality: This method relies heavily on the quality and representativeness of the accuracy scores you use to calculate μ and σ. Ensure they cover a good range of typical tasks and difficulties.

Distribution: This method works best when your accuracy scores are somewhat normally distributed (or at least unimodal). If you have a very skewed or multi-modal distribution, the interpretation might be less reliable.

Subjectivity: The choice of multipliers (0.5, 1.0, 1.5) is subjective. You might need to adjust them based on your specific context, the importance of accuracy for your application, and your tolerance for variation.

Absolute Thresholds: You might also want to combine this relative approach with absolute thresholds. For example, regardless of μ and σ, an accuracy below 50% might always be considered "Red."

Context: Always interpret these thresholds within the context of the specific task and domain. What constitutes "good" or "bad" accuracy can vary greatly.
