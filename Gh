1. Accuracy
Method: Mean – Standard Deviation

Rationale: This approach helps identify outputs significantly below the typical performance, ensuring that only sufficiently accurate responses are considered acceptable.

2. Completeness
Method: 5th Percentile of All Completeness Scores

Rationale: Since completeness can vary with question complexity, the 5th percentile serves as a robust lower bound to flag only the most incomplete responses.

3. Context Relevance
Method: Mean – Standard Deviation

Rationale: Similar to accuracy, this method filters out responses that fall significantly short in maintaining contextual relevance.

4. Semantic Relevance
Method: Median or Interquartile Range (IQR)

Rationale: To reduce the influence of outliers and maintain robustness, the IQR method was applied. Only responses falling within the typical middle range of semantic relevance scores are accepted.
