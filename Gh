Request-Level Detailed View
For a more granular analysis, the platform provides a request-level view that allows for an in-depth examination of each individual query. This view is designed for detailed quality checks and targeted analysis.

Advanced Filtering
The data in this view can be precisely filtered to isolate specific records. The available filters include:

Value Streams
Markets
Date Range
User Name
Request ID
Evaluation Details
Once filtered, the view presents a table with the following information:

Row-wise Data: Each row corresponds to a single processed request, showing the specific scores for the five key metrics: Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, Context Relevance, and Semantic Relevance.
Breach Summary: A summary count highlights the total number of requests that are breaching one or more of the predefined metric thresholds, allowing for a quick assessment of overall quality within the filtered dataset.
SME Feedback and Action
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) can interact directly with the evaluations in this view:

Provide Feedback: SMEs can review and add feedback to any specific request where they feel the automated evaluation is not as expected.
Take Action: This feedback mechanism allows teams to flag specific records so that appropriate action can be taken to investigate and resolve any underlying issues.

For offline analysis, reporting, or further investigation, the filtered records in this view can be easily exported in an Excel format.
