9. Reporting
The ongoing monitoring plan must establish a structured reporting process to inform key stakeholders about the model's performance, identified issues, and corrective actions undertaken during periodic monitoring.​

9.1 Reporting Objectives
Transparency: Provide clear insights into the model's performance metrics and any deviations from expected outcomes.​

Accountability: Document identified issues, root causes, and the steps taken to address them.​

Continuous Improvement: Facilitate informed decision-making to enhance model reliability and effectiveness.​

9.2 Reporting Frequency and Formats
Weekly Performance Summaries:

Format: Concise reports highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs), recent trends, and any immediate concerns.​

Distribution: Shared with the Model Monitoring Team and Risk Management Role Holders.​

Monthly Comprehensive Reports:

Format: Detailed analyses encompassing all monitored metrics, identified issues, root cause analyses, and implemented mitigation strategies.​

Distribution: Circulated to the AI Governance Team and made accessible to Risk Management Role Holders.​

Quarterly Executive Summaries:

Format: High-level overviews emphasizing strategic insights, long-term trends, and recommendations for policy or process adjustments.​

Distribution: Presented to the Executive Oversight (Risk Committee) during quarterly reviews.​

9.3 Reporting Forums and Stakeholder Engagement
Weekly Monitoring Meetings:

Participants: Model Monitoring Team and Risk Management Role Holders.​

Purpose: Review weekly summaries, discuss immediate concerns, and coordinate prompt responses to emerging issues.​

Monthly Governance Reviews:

Participants: AI Governance Team and Model Monitoring Team.​

Purpose: Evaluate monthly comprehensive reports, assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and plan for any necessary model adjustments.​

Quarterly Risk Committee Meetings:

Participants: Executive Oversight (Risk Committee), AI Governance Team, and representatives from the Model Monitoring Team.​

Purpose: Discuss executive summaries, deliberate on strategic implications, and approve recommendations for policy or operational changes.​

9.4 Stakeholder Notification Protocols
Immediate Notifications:

Trigger: Detection of critical issues (e.g., metrics in the Red Zone).​

Recipients: Model Monitoring Team, AI Governance Team, and relevant Risk Management Role Holders.​

Method: Real-time alerts via email and dashboard notifications.​

Scheduled Notifications:

Trigger: Regular reporting intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly).​

Recipients: As per the distribution lists outlined in sections 9.2 and 9.3.​

Method: Email distribution of reports and scheduled meetings.​

9.5 Documentation and Record-Keeping
Archival: All reports and meeting minutes are systematically archived in a centralized document management system to ensure traceability and support future audits.​

Access Control: Access to reports is restricted based on roles and responsibilities to maintain confidentiality and data integrity.​

This structured reporting framework ensures that all relevant stakeholders are consistently informed about the RMC Risk Management Copilot's performance, fostering transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.​
