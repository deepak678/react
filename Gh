Problem Statement
Company Context:
You are a data engineer for a financial services firm that provides real-time trading analytics and risk assessment. The firm needs to integrate data from various sources to create a comprehensive view of market conditions, client portfolios, and transaction histories.

Objective:
Design and implement a robust data pipeline that:

Orchestrates the extraction of data from multiple real-time and batch sources.
Transforms and cleans the data to ensure consistency, integrity, and accuracy.
Performs real-time analytics to provide immediate insights on market conditions and risk exposure.
Ensures data quality through rigorous validation and auditing processes.
Loads the processed data into a data warehouse for further analysis and reporting.
Requirements:

Data Extraction:

Market Data: Extract real-time market data (e.g., stock prices, exchange rates) from a financial market data provider using WebSocket APIs.
Client Portfolios: Extract daily snapshots of client portfolios from an SFTP server containing CSV files.
Transaction Histories: Extract historical transaction data from a PostgreSQL database.
Data Transformation:

Normalize the data to ensure a consistent format (e.g., timestamps, currency conversion).
Clean and validate the data (e.g., handle missing values, detect anomalies).
Aggregate transaction data to calculate key metrics (e.g., portfolio value, risk metrics).
Enrich market data with additional contextual information (e.g., financial news sentiment analysis).
Real-Time Analytics:

Use a stream processing framework (e.g., Apache Kafka Streams, Apache Flink) to process and analyze market data in real-time.
Calculate real-time risk exposure for each client portfolio based on market conditions.
Data Loading:

Load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL data warehouse.
Ensure that real-time insights are stored in a separate high-performance database (e.g., Redis) for immediate access by trading systems.
Data Orchestration:

Use an orchestration tool (e.g., Apache Airflow, Prefect) to schedule and manage the pipeline.
Implement error handling and notifications to alert the data engineering team of any issues.
Data Quality Assurance:

Implement rigorous data validation and auditing processes to ensure data integrity.
Track data lineage to maintain an audit trail of data transformations and ensure regulatory compliance.
Tasks:
Design the Data Pipeline:

Create a high-level design of the data pipeline, including a flowchart or diagram that shows the flow of data from extraction to loading and real-time processing.
Implement the Data Pipeline:

Write scripts to extract data from the WebSocket API, SFTP server, and PostgreSQL database.
Perform necessary data transformations and validation checks.
Implement real-time analytics using a stream processing framework.
Load the processed data into the PostgreSQL data warehouse and Redis database.
Orchestration:

Use Apache Airflow (or a similar tool) to schedule and manage the pipeline.
Implement error handling and notifications.
Testing and Validation:

Test the pipeline with sample data to ensure it works as expected.
Validate the integrity and accuracy of the loaded data.
Ensure the real-time processing provides accurate and timely insights.
Expected Deliverables:
Pipeline Design: A document or diagram outlining the pipeline architecture.
Source Code: Scripts for data extraction, transformation, loading, and real-time processing.
Orchestration Workflow: Configuration and scripts for the orchestration tool.
Data Quality Assurance: Documentation of data validation and auditing processes.
Documentation: Instructions on how to set up and run the pipeline, including any dependencies and configurations.
This problem is more complex and requires the candidate to handle real-time data processing, stringent data quality requirements, and the integration of multiple data sources.
