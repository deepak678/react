Here’s a structured **Requirement Epic for Release 3 of ADA** based on your description. I’ve written it in an Agile-style format so it can go directly into your backlog:

---

## Epic: **Release 3 – Dashboard Metrics & Filters Enhancement (ADA)**

### Epic Description

As a **user of ADA dashboard**, I want to **view key metrics with customizable filters**, so that I can **track performance, feedback, and efficiency of query handling** in a given period.

This release will enable displaying metrics (calculated in R1 & R2) on the dashboard with new filter options and a default date range view.

---

### Business Value

This epic provides transparency and insights into the ADA platform performance by allowing business users to slice and dice data by month, type, location, and date range, ensuring accurate monitoring and informed decision-making.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

#### 1. Filters

* **Reporting Month**: Dropdown of available reporting months.
* **Request Type**: Multi-select dropdown.
* **Request Location**: Multi-select dropdown.
* **Date Range**: Calendar selector with default = *Last full month*.

  * Example: If today is any date in **September 2025**, default range = **01-Aug-2025 to 31-Aug-2025**.

#### 2. Metrics to Display (with definitions)

1. **Queries Submitted** – Count of all request IDs submitted within selected filters.
2. **Closed Queries** – Count of all request IDs closed within selected filters.
3. **Advice Issued TAT** – Average turnaround time of advice issued within selected filters.
4. **Positive Feedback** –

   * Count = Queries with L1 feedback = Thumbs Up.
   * % = (Thumbs Up feedback count) / (All queries with feedback \[submitted + closed]).
5. **Negative Feedback** –

   * Count = Queries with L1 feedback = Thumbs Down.
   * % = (Thumbs Down feedback count) / (All queries with feedback \[submitted + closed]).
6. **Right First Time (RFT)** – Count of queries marked with RFT flag within closed queries in the selected period.
7. **Confidence Indicator (RAG)** – Distribution of queries across Red/Amber/Green within selected filters (both submitted & closed).

#### 3. Default View

* On first load of the dashboard:

  * **Filters** pre-populated (last month, all request types, all locations).
  * **Metrics** populated accordingly.
* Users can override defaults using filters.

---

### Dependencies

* Metrics calculation logic (already developed in R1 & R2).
* Data availability in backend reporting layer.
* UI components for filters and metrics display.

---

### Out of Scope

* New metric definitions or changes to R1 & R2 metric calculation logic.
* Historical data corrections.

---

### Deliverables

* Updated **dashboard UI** with filters.
* Metrics displayed as per definitions.
* Default date range = last full month.

---

Would you like me to also **break this epic down into user stories** (e.g., *“As a user, I want to filter by reporting month”*, *“As a user, I want to see Queries Submitted metric”*, etc.), so you can directly slot them into your backlog?
