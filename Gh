🎥 Script: Model Monitoring for Model Risk Management (2 minutes)

👋 [Warm tone]
Hello everyone,
I’m [Your Name], and today I’d like to talk about something that’s becoming increasingly important as we embrace Artificial Intelligence across HSBC — Model Monitoring for Model Risk Management, especially in the era of Generative AI.

🧠 What it is:
In simple terms, model monitoring means continuously keeping an eye on how our AI and machine learning models behave once they are deployed. Just like we monitor a car’s performance to ensure it runs smoothly, model monitoring helps us ensure our AI systems remain accurate, fair, and reliable over time.

⚙️ Why it matters:
AI models — especially generative models — learn from large and dynamic data. Over time, data patterns change, customer behaviors evolve, or business rules are updated. If we don’t monitor our models, they can start producing inaccurate, biased, or even risky outputs — something that can directly affect decisions, customer trust, and regulatory compliance.

💡 Simple example:
Imagine we have a generative AI model summarizing customer feedback to identify potential service issues. Initially, it performs very well. But six months later, customers start using new terms or slang that the model wasn’t trained on. Without monitoring, the model might start missing important signals — giving a false sense that everything’s fine.
Model monitoring would catch this drift early, helping us retrain or fine-tune before it impacts business or compliance outcomes.

🤝 The bigger picture:
Model monitoring isn’t just a technical task — it’s a shared responsibility across risk, compliance, and technology teams. It helps ensure that AI is transparent, explainable, and trustworthy — aligning perfectly with HSBC’s risk management culture and our regulatory commitments.

🚀 Closing (inspirational tone):
As we move forward in this exciting AI journey, let’s come together — risk professionals, technologists, and business teams — to make sure our AI systems remain safe, reliable, and aligned with our values.
Because responsible AI isn’t just about innovation — it’s about trust.

Thank you.
