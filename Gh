Performance Test Plan for RMC Risk Management Copilot
The performance test plan evaluates the RMC's ability to transform unstructured issue descriptions and titles into a structured 5C format while ensuring accuracy, completeness, and reliability.

Step 1: Test Case Selection
To ensure a comprehensive assessment, test cases will be selected based on the following criteria:

1.1 Input Complexity Levels
Simple Cases: Well-structured issue descriptions with clear 5C components.

Moderate Cases: Issues with implicit cause or consequence requiring inference.

Complex Cases: Ambiguous descriptions with missing components that require contextual understanding.

1.2 Data Diversity
Domain Coverage: Financial risk, operational risk, compliance risk, etc.

Varying Input Lengths: Short vs. long issue descriptions.

Missing Information Scenarios: Cases where additional information should or should not be inferred.

Step 2: Baseline Comparison & Ground Truth Generation
For accurate evaluation, a gold-standard dataset (ground truth) will be created by:

Manually structuring a sample set of issues into the 5C format using SMEs.

Assigning scores for accuracy, completeness, and hallucination based on SME evaluation.

Creating a dataset of acceptable and unacceptable transformations to train and validate the model's consistency.

Step 3: Evaluation Metrics & Scoring Methodology
The RMC system output will be evaluated against the ground truth based on the following metrics:

3.1 Completeness Score (1-5 Scale)
Score 5 – All 5C elements present and correctly extracted.

Score 4 – One minor component missing but no impact on interpretation.

Score 3 – One major component missing, requiring manual intervention.

Score 2 – Multiple key components missing, significantly impacting usability.

Score 1 – Output is largely incomplete and unusable.

3.2 Accuracy Score (1-5 Scale)
Score 5 – Fully correct extraction, no hallucinations, and high semantic overlap with the ground truth.

Score 4 – Minor discrepancies but overall aligned.

Score 3 – Noticeable errors but retains partial correctness.

Score 2 – Major factual inaccuracies affecting usability.

Score 1 – Output is largely incorrect.

3.3 Hallucination Detection (Yes/No)
Yes – If any information is generated in the output that was not present in the input.

No – If output strictly adheres to the input information without extrapolation.

3.4 Consistency Score (1-5 Scale)
Score 5 – Identical issues receive identical structured outputs.

Score 4 – Minor variations but still understandable.

Score 3 – Moderate variations requiring review.

Score 2 – Significant inconsistencies making the model unreliable.

Score 1 – No consistency; outputs for similar inputs vary widely.

Step 4: Threshold Definition & Pass Criteria
Metric	Threshold for Acceptance
Completeness	≥ 90% cases should score ≥ 4
Accuracy	≥ 85% cases should score ≥ 4
Hallucination	≤ 5% cases flagged as ‘Yes’
Consistency	≥ 80% cases should score ≥ 4
If the model fails to meet the above criteria, retraining and parameter adjustments will be required.

Step 5: Continuous Monitoring & Automation
Automated Weekly Testing: Run scheduled AI-to-AI validation using LangChain-based LLM scoring.

Real-Time Error Logging: Any structured output failing the threshold will be logged in Helios for SME review.

Periodic Human Evaluation: A quarterly manual review of random samples to detect unnoticed drifts.

Feedback Loop for Model Improvement: Any deviations will be fed back into the training pipeline to iteratively refine performance.
