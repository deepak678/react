Title: Evaluation Framework for LLM Outputs Using Metrics and Feedback
Subtitle: A Structured Approach for Measuring Accuracy, Completeness, and Hallucination Severity

Slide 2: Problem Statement
Objective:
To evaluate the quality of language model outputs against a structured framework when:

Inputs are provided in the form of an Issue Title and Issue Description.
Outputs follow a predefined 5 C's framework:
Condition: What is or was the problem?
Context: How big is or was the problem?
Criteria: By what standard is or was it judged?
Consequence: What risk does this expose?
Cause: Why did it happen?
Slide 3: Challenges
Lack of Ground Truth:
No reference outputs to directly compare the generated responses.
Subjective Metrics:
Evaluating aspects like "completeness" and "hallucination" can vary depending on interpretation.
Output Inconsistencies:
Model responses may differ in format, missing elements of the framework, or including hallucinations.
Slide 4: Approach Overview
Goal: To design an automated and scalable evaluation pipeline that:

Assesses outputs using structured metrics (accuracy, completeness, hallucination).
Ensures consistent evaluation and format adherence.
Aggregates results from multiple evaluations for actionable insights.
Key Components:

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination Severity.
Feedback Aggregation: Averages scores across multiple evaluations.
Retry Mechanism: Ensures adherence to strict formats.
Slide 5: Workflow
Input Data:

Issue Title and Description.
Model Output:

Adheres to the 5 C's framework and includes "additional information" on missing/incomplete elements.
Evaluation Step:

Use a structured Evaluation Prompt to assess:
Accuracy: Alignment with input details.
Completeness: Inclusion of all 5 C's and additional information.
Hallucination: Presence and severity of unsupported claims.
Feedback Aggregation:

Collate results from multiple evaluations to calculate average scores.
Results Summary:

Consistent feedback in a structured JSON format.
Slide 6: Key Prompts
Evaluation Prompt:

Guides the model to score outputs based on metrics.
Ensures JSON-formatted results for programmatic analysis.
Feedback Prompt:

Aggregates evaluations, computing average metrics for insights.
Enforces a standardized output structure for consistency.
Slide 7: Code Overview
Main Components:

Evaluation Chain:

Processes model outputs using the Evaluation Prompt.
Validates responses for structure and content.
Feedback Chain:

Aggregates scores using the Feedback Prompt.
Computes averages for all metrics.
Validation Logic:

Ensures JSON outputs adhere to the expected format.
Key Metrics:

Accuracy: Measures alignment with input.
Completeness: Assesses 5 C's coverage and missing elements.
Hallucination: Evaluates fabricated or unsupported claims.
Slide 8: How It Works
Step	Description
Input Preparation	Issue Title and Description are fed into the system.
Output Evaluation	Model outputs are scored based on the 5 C's framework and additional criteria.
JSON Validation	Ensures outputs are formatted correctly for analysis.
Feedback Aggregation	Averages scores across multiple evaluations for actionable insights.
Results Generation	Outputs average scores for accuracy, completeness, and hallucination severity.
Slide 9: Benefits of This Approach
Scalable and Automated:

Eliminates manual effort in scoring large datasets.
Consistency:

Prompts enforce strict formatting and criteria adherence.
Comprehensive Evaluation:

Metrics cover multiple dimensions of output quality, including hallucination severity.
Actionable Insights:

Aggregated scores provide clarity on overall model performance.
Slide 10: Addressing Output Variability
Retry Logic:

Handles inconsistencies by re-running the evaluation if the output fails validation.
Embedding-Based Analysis:

Leverages embeddings to compare and evaluate text similarity for more robust scoring.
Standardized Prompts:

Revised prompts reduce variability and align results with evaluation criteria.
Slide 11: Results Interpretation
Accuracy: Measures how well the output aligns with input requirements.
Completeness: Evaluates whether all elements of the 5 C's are covered.
Hallucination Severity: Identifies and rates unsupported claims, aiding risk assessment.
Slide 12: Future Enhancements
Enhanced Scoring Models:

Use embeddings and ML models to refine scoring mechanisms further.
Ground Truth Augmentation:

Collaborate with manual testers to create benchmark outputs for better comparisons.
Adaptive Feedback Loops:

Continuously improve prompts and evaluation criteria based on iterative analysis.
Slide 13: Conclusion
This evaluation framework provides a robust and scalable solution for assessing language model outputs. By combining structured prompts, automated scoring, and feedback aggregation, it ensures reliable performance metrics for decision-making and continuous improvement.
