For all other abbreviations:

If the expanded form appears in the output, but not in the input, and it's not in the ignore list, flag it as a hallucinated expansion.

Do not count formatting differences (like "CBUAE" vs. "CB UAE") as expansion.

⚠️ Important:
Do not infer or guess meaning — only check what is explicitly present in the input and output.

You must ignore any abbreviation on the ignore list even if its expansion is not in the input.
