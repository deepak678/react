Monitoring Data
The scope and nature of the data used for monitoring are critical to ensuring accurate evaluation. This section outlines the data sources, collection methodology, sample size, representativeness, and approach for expected output verification.

2.1 Data Source
The monitoring process will utilize audit logs as the primary data source. These logs capture all relevant transactions, providing a complete record of input issue descriptions, structured outputs, and system interactions.

2.2 Data Collection Methodology
Data will be directly extracted from audit logs, ensuring no additional data processing or transformation is required before evaluation.

The monitoring system will continuously retrieve logs to ensure real-time assessment.

2.3 Sample Size & Representativeness
The monitoring process will be applied to the entire set of audit logs, ensuring a full population analysis rather than a sampled subset.

Since the entire dataset is used, the monitored data fully represents the operational landscape of RMC Risk Management Copilot.

2.4 Ground Truth & Expected Output Verification
Ground truth data is not explicitly available, as the LLM does not generate new content but restructures the input into a predefined framework.

To ensure evaluation accuracy, a manual review process is used to validate that the output follows the 5C's structure, issue severity rationale, and additional information sections correctly.

The expected output is determined by human reviewers, ensuring alignment with the intended structured format.
