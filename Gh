Thank you for being a part of the insightful conversation about evaluation metrics. Your contributions were invaluable as we work toward refining this process.

Here are some key points to consider as we move forward:

Overlapping Definitions: We need to analyze where the definitions for different metrics overlap and identify opportunities to streamline them for better clarity.
SME Collaboration: It's essential to sit down with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to discuss their perspectives on evaluation improvement and understand the reasoning behind the scores they have provided.
Generalization of Scores: We need to think critically about how to generalize the scoring process for users, ensuring consistency despite varying and sometimes confusing metrics.
In our next steps, we plan to explore additional metrics, including consistency, context relevance, and semantic relevance, to further enhance our evaluation framework.

We look forward to your continued insights as we refine and improve this process. Please feel free to share any further thoughts or suggestions.
