Need to write an epic where it should have epic summary goal acceptance criteria 
Wr need to build mvp 1 of model simulation which we need to validate performance of model / evaluation model on production data it should have capacity to use historical data export the results could be evaluation results or outputs produced by llm for a use case
We should be able to alter evaluation as well as use case prompt 
Should have capacity to select different models 
User should be able to select date range of data for which they want to find the results 
If user selects job which is going to take some time it's progress should be visible it's pending failed completed
We need to do it as there are very quick model changes

Here‚Äôs an example of how you can write this as an Epic, including its summary, goal, and acceptance criteria:

üéØ Epic: Model Simulation and Evaluation MVP
üìù Summary
Build the first MVP of a Model Simulation and Evaluation Framework that allows users to validate the performance of different models on production data. The framework must enable historical data playback, run simulations, and export results. Users should be able to:

Alter the evaluation prompt and use case.

Choose which model to run.

Select a date range for the data.

Monitor the status of long-running jobs.

ü•Ö Goal
Develop an MVP that provides a robust, flexible, and user-friendly way to:

Evaluate different LLMs quickly,

Validate their performance using actual production data,

Export the results,

Maintain visibility on job status,

Minimize delays caused by rapid model changes.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
Data Selection:

Users can select a date range from which production data will be pulled.

Ability to use historical data for evaluation.

Model & Prompt Management:

Users can select from a list of available models.

Users can customize the prompt or use case text for the evaluation.

Execution & Monitoring:

User can launch an evaluation job.

Status of jobs is visible and includes states: Pending, In-Progress, Completed, Failed.

Output Export:

Results (both evaluation metrics and model outputs) can be exported/downloaded.

Adaptation for New Models:

Framework supports quick swaps and testing of new model versions.

User Experience:

Simple and intuitive user interface for selecting model, prompt, date range, and triggering jobs.

Clear status indicators and error messages.
