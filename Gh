Accuracy is evaluated based on factual correctness and expected content. Additionally, accuracy is influenced by the completeness of the response and the presence or absence of hallucinated information. A response with missing key components or hallucinated details will inherently have lower accuracy.

Accuracy measures how well the response aligns with factual correctness and expected content. The scoring criteria are as follows:

Score (1-5)

Criteria

5 (Excellent)

The response is factually correct, fully aligned with the expected answer, and has no errors.

4 (Good)

The response is mostly accurate but may contain minor errors or omissions that do not impact the overall correctness.

3 (Satisfactory)

The response contains noticeable factual inaccuracies but still conveys some correct information.

2 (Needs Improvement)

The response has significant factual errors that reduce its reliability.

1 (Poor)

The response is completely incorrect or misleading.

4.4 Hallucination Scoring Framework

Hallucination measures whether the response includes information that is not supported by the input data. The scoring criteria are as follows:

Hallucination

Criteria

No

The response is entirely based on input data with no unsupported information.

Yes

The response contains information that is not present in the input data and is considered hallucinated.
