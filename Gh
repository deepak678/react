4.1 Accuracy, Completeness & Hallucination Detection

Methodology: AI-to-AI evaluation using LangChain.

Process: A two-prompt approach is used where the first prompt evaluates response coverage, accuracy, and potential hallucinations. The second prompt assigns structured scores based on the evaluation done using the 5C's framework (Condition, Context, Criteria, Consequence, Cause) and provides individual scores for each metric.
