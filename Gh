Subject: Non-Response to Grievances Regarding Ineligible EPS Contribution Since Jan 2019

Dear EPFO Officer,

I am writing to formally raise a concern regarding an issue that I have already submitted multiple grievances for, but unfortunately, I have not received any response or resolution so far.

My concern pertains to the EPS (Employee Pension Scheme) contribution that has been getting deducted from my salary since January 2019. I recently came to know that I am not eligible for EPS as per the applicable EPFO guidelines. Despite this, deductions toward EPS have continued to be made from my salary every month.

My Request:
I request that:

All EPS contributions made so far be merged into my EPF balance.

I receive written confirmation from EPFO regarding the same, which I can submit to my current organization to stop the ongoing EPS contributions.

Previous Grievances Raised:
I have already submitted multiple grievances on this matter. Below are the most recent grievance IDs for your reference:

Grievance ID 1: [<Insert ID here>]

Grievance ID 2: [<Insert ID here>]

Despite the time that has passed, there has been no response or acknowledgement. I am now compelled to escalate this matter due to the financial and procedural implications it is causing.

I request your urgent attention and a formal resolution on this matter. Kindly look into the issue and provide a written clarification or action plan at the earliest.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
