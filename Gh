What‚Äôs the difference between a list and a tuple?
Answer: A list is mutable (you can change its elements), whereas a tuple is immutable (you can‚Äôt change its elements after creation).

‚ö°Ô∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between is and ==?
Answer:

is checks if both variables point to the same object in memory (object identity).

== checks if the values of the objects are equal.

‚ö°Ô∏è 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is a generator in Python?
Answer: A generator is a special function that uses yield to produce a sequence of values one at a time, allowing for iteration without storing the entire sequence in memory.

‚ö°Ô∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)?
Answer: The GIL is a mutex in CPython that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This means threads don‚Äôt run in true parallel, although I/O‚Äëbound threads can still benefit from multithreading.

‚ö°Ô∏è 5Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
Answer:

Shallow copy: Copies the parent object, but doesn‚Äôt recursively copy nested objects (both copies share nested objects).

Deep copy: Copies the parent object and recursively copies all nested objects.

‚ö°Ô∏è 6Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the role of the init method?
Answer: The __init__ method is called when creating a new object of a class. It initializes the object‚Äôs attributes.

‚ö°Ô∏è 7Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between class method, static method, and instance method?
Answer:

Instance method: Operates on an instance of the class (self is required).

Class method: Operates on the class itself (cls is required).

Static method: Doesn‚Äôt operate on an instance or class (@staticmethod), behaves like a regular function.

‚ö°Ô∏è 8Ô∏è‚É£ What are args and kwargs used for?
Answer:

args: Allows passing a variable number of positional arguments.

kwargs: Allows passing a variable number of keyword arguments.

‚ö°Ô∏è 9Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between an error and an exception?
Answer: An error is an issue that occurs when the interpreter can‚Äôt run the code, like syntax errors. An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program, which can be caught and handled.

‚ö°Ô∏è 10Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between raise and assert?
Answer:

raise: Manually triggers an exception.

assert: A debugging aid that verifies a condition is True. Raises an AssertionError if not.

‚ö°Ô∏è 11Ô∏è‚É£ What are decorators in Python?
Answer: Decorators are special functions that wrap another function, allowing you to add behavior (like logging, caching, or access control) without changing the original function‚Äôs code.

‚ö°Ô∏è 12Ô∏è‚É£ What is a namespace in Python?
Answer: A namespace is a mapping between names and objects. It allows you to use the same name in different contexts (global, local, built-in) without conflict.

‚ö°Ô∏è 13Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between a module and a package?
Answer:

A module is a single .py file.

A package is a directory containing an __init__.py file, making it a collection of modules.

‚ö°Ô∏è 14Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of the main block?
Answer: The if __name__ == "__main__": block allows code to be executed only when the file is run directly, and not when it‚Äôs imported as a module.

‚ö°Ô∏è 15Ô∏è‚É£ What are common ways to manage virtual environments?
Answer: Tools like venv or conda create isolated environments for Python projects, allowing you to manage dependencies without affecting the global installation.
