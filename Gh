 Abbreviation Fidelity:** Verify all abbreviation expansions present in the Generated Response (e.g., instances like 'Full Phrase (Abbr)' or 'Abbr (Full Phrase)'). For each expansion found, check the original Input Text. If the Input Text contained the abbreviation (e.g., 'Abbr') but *did not* contain the corresponding 'Full Phrase' explicitly linked to it, then the expansion in the Generated Response is incorrect according to evaluation criteria. Such unsolicited expansions detract from accuracy.
