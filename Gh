Create an epic to implement model reliance on the production this calculation will be done between final issue recorded in helios with the ai response generated the model reliance metric 
The calculation logic is defined as a cosine similarity between these response logic of which will be provided 
That value needs to be shown in the admin portal and average of value with a trend graph how it is happening for other metrics in RMC and in model evaluation performance a column needs to be added to show model reliance for their respective row

Thought for a couple of seconds
Epic: Implement Model Reliance metric in production (Helios → Admin Portal / RMC / Model Evaluation)
Epic ID: MR-EPIC-001
Owner: (Product/Model Monitoring)
Stakeholders: Data Engineering, ML Engineering, Backend, Frontend (Admin Portal), RMC team, QA, Analytics

Summary
Introduce Model Reliance — a production metric that measures similarity between the final issue recorded in Helios and the AI response generated. The metric will be calculated as a cosine similarity over vectorized representations (vectorization logic to be provided). Display the per-request model reliance value in the Admin Portal, show an aggregated average + trend graph (same style as existing RMC metrics), and add a Model Reliance column to Model Evaluation Performance tables.

Goals
Compute a reliable, auditable model_reliance score (0–1) per production request.

Surface per-request score and aggregated views (average and trend) in the Admin Portal and RMC dashboards.

Add model_reliance to the model evaluation performance dataset and UI table.

Ensure traceability (Helios request id ↔ AI response ↔ computed score).

Monitoring, alerting and tests to ensure correctness and stability.

Scope (in-scope / out-of-scope)
In-scope

Implementation of cosine-similarity calculation pipeline for each processed pair (Helios final issue ↔ AI response).

Storage of per-request model_reliance value and metadata.

Admin Portal: per-request view, average metric, trend graph (time-series), and a column in model evaluation performance table.

Backfill historic values (optional — included as a task).

Unit/integration tests, dashboards for telemetry.

Out-of-scope

Changing vectorization model/embedding generation logic (unless requested).

Re-architecting Helios or AI generation systems beyond required instrumentation.

Fine-grained UX redesign of dashboards beyond adding graph & column.

Assumptions & Inputs
Vectorization & cosine similarity logic (embedding model, normalization, pooling, pre-processing) will be provided by the ML team (or will be chosen per their guidance).

Helios final issue text and AI response text are available and durable (or can be captured) for each request.

Existing RMC trend graph component / time-series pipeline can be re-used for the new metric styling and aggregation.

Timezone: Asia/Kolkata (use absolute timestamps for clarity in dashboards).

Acceptance Criteria (top-level)
For every processed Helios record with an AI response, a numeric model_reliance score (float between 0 and 1) is produced and stored.

Admin Portal per-request details page shows the model_reliance score and the underlying inputs (Helios final issue text & AI response text) with timestamp and request id.

Admin Portal RMC dashboard shows:

A trend chart (daily/week/month selectable) of average model_reliance (same style/filters as other RMC metrics).

A KPI card showing the current average model_reliance for the selected time window.

Model Evaluation Performance table includes a Model Reliance column for each row, populated for all rows where data exists.

Aggregations (average, standard deviation, count) computed for model_reliance are available via API and dashboard filters: reporting month, request type, request location, date range.

Unit tests for cosine similarity calculation (including edge cases: missing text, very short texts).

Integration tests ensuring traceability of request → computed score → UI display.

Backfill script (if run) populates historical model_reliance values without duplications and with a configurable batch size.

Telemetry (success/failure counts, latency histogram for metric calculation) is emitted; alerts exist for failure rate > X% (TBD) or calc latency > Y ms.

Documentation updated (calculation spec with exact preprocessing, embedding model + version, and sample calculations).

User Stories & Tasks
A. Data / Backend
Story A1 — Capture inputs

Task A1.1: Ensure Helios final issue text and AI response text are captured/stored in the message/event store with stable request_id.

Task A1.2: Add hooks to ensure pre-processed text snapshot (raw + normalized) persisted for audit.

Story A2 — Vectorization & similarity service

Task A2.1: Implement a microservice/function compute_model_reliance(request_id, helios_text, ai_response) that:

runs pre-processing (lowercase, token normalization, punctuation rules — per spec),

obtains embeddings (call to embedding model/service),

computes cosine similarity,

returns float in [0,1] and metadata (embedding ids, version).

Task A2.2: Add unit tests for numeric stability and missing-input handling.

Story A3 — Storage

Task A3.1: DB schema change: add table model_reliance or add columns to existing metrics table:

id, request_id (FK), helios_text_snapshot_id, ai_response_snapshot_id, reliance_score (float), embedding_model_version, computed_at, pipeline_version.

Task A3.2: Add indexes on computed_at, request_id, and request_location to support dashboard queries.

Story A4 — Batch/backfill

Task A4.1: Create backfill job (idempotent) to compute and store historical model_reliance for existing records.

Task A4.2: Create throttling & checkpointing for the backfill to avoid DB overload.

Story A5 — API

Task A5.1: Add endpoints:

GET /metrics/model_reliance?start=...&end=...&group_by=day&filters=... (returns time-series aggregates)

GET /requests/{id} includes model_reliance and related metadata

GET /model_evaluation?filters... that includes model_reliance per row

Task A5.2: Add authorization checks and caching.

B. Frontend / Admin Portal
Story B1 — Per-request view

Task B1.1: UI component to show Model Reliance score with tooltip explaining calculation (embedding model version and date).

Task B1.2: Show Helios final issue text and AI response text side-by-side; provide a copy-to-clipboard and "Show raw/normalized" toggle.

Acceptance: Matches existing per-request metrics layout and includes a console-style change log for when score was computed.

Story B2 — RMC Trend & KPI

Task B2.1: Re-use RMC chart component to add Model Reliance timeseries (avg per day) with same filters (reporting month, request type, request location, date-range).

Task B2.2: KPI card showing current average and delta vs previous period.

Task B2.3: Allow hover to see exact average and count for each point.

Story B3 — Model Evaluation Performance table

Task B3.1: Add Model Reliance column to the performance table; support sorting and filtering.

Task B3.2: If value missing, show — with a tooltip "Not computed".

Task B3.3: Add small sparkline (optional) per row to show how reliance changed across time for that model (if applicable).

Story B4 — UX/Help

Task B4.1: Add documentation modal / help text: definition, interpretation, caveats (e.g., cosine similarity scale, embedding model version).

Task B4.2: Accessibility and responsiveness (mobile).

C. Observability & Monitoring
Story C1 — Telemetry

Task C1.1: Emit metrics: calculation latency, success/failure count, input lengths distribution, embedding model errors.

Task C1.2: Add dashboards for operational monitoring.

Story C2 — Alerts

Task C2.1: Alert when >X% calculation failures in 1 hour.

Task C2.2: Alert on unusual drop/increase in average model_reliance (statistical anomaly).

D. QA & Testing

Integration tests from Helios event → stored model_reliance → UI display.

Load test for batch/backfill and regular pipeline throughput.

Security and data privacy review (ensure no PII leakage in monitoring logs).

E. Documentation & Training
Calculation spec doc: input pre-processing, embedding model + version, similarity formula, rounding rules.

Release notes and admin guide + FAQ for stakeholders explaining interpretation and caveats.

Short training demo for RMC & model evaluation teams.

Data Model (proposed)
CREATE TABLE model_reliance (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  request_id UUID REFERENCES requests(id),
  helios_snapshot_id UUID,
  ai_response_snapshot_id UUID,
  reliance_score DOUBLE PRECISION, -- 0 to 1
  embedding_model VARCHAR(64),
  pipeline_version VARCHAR(32),
  computed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
Add to model_evaluation table:

model_reliance_score DOUBLE PRECISION NULL

API Contract (examples)
GET /api/v1/metrics/model_reliance?start=2025-09-01&end=2025-09-14&group_by=day&filters=...

returns: [{date: "2025-09-01", avg: 0.74, std: 0.12, count: 560}, ...]

GET /api/v1/requests/{id}

response includes model_reliance: {score: 0.83, computed_at: "...", embedding_version: "v1.2"}

Rollout Plan
Implement compute service + small-scale deploy to staging.

Run integration tests on staging with sample Helios data.

Deploy storage + API changes.

Release frontend changes to staging; validate UI/filters with stakeholders.

Run controlled backfill on a small historical window; validate results.

Full backfill (if approved) with monitoring and throttling.

Production deploy & monitor health metrics for 48–72 hours.

Risks & Mitigations
Embedding model version changes — Mitigate by recording embedding_model and pipeline_version per row; allow re-compute with a specified version.

High compute cost for embeddings — Mitigate via batching, caching embeddings for identical texts, or using lightweight embedding model.

Incomplete Helios / AI text — Mark score as not_computed and surface reason in UI.

Interpretability — Provide clear docs and examples showing what high/low scores mean.

Estimated Work Breakdown (Sprints)
(Provide as guidance — adjust to team velocity)

Sprint 1: Backend compute service + DB schema + unit tests.

Sprint 2: API + small frontend per-request UI + telemetry.

Sprint 3: RMC trend graph + model evaluation table column + backfill script.

Sprint 4: QA, load testing, docs, and production rollout.

Deliverables
compute_model_reliance service with tests.

DB schema + migration.

API endpoints.

Admin Portal updates: per-request view, KPI card, trend graph, table column.

Backfill script.

Documentation and runbook.

Monitoring and alerts.

If you want, I can:

convert this into JIRA-ready user stories with issue templates and estimates,

produce the exact UI wireframes (mockups) matching your modern style preferences and add console message section as you like, or

write the SQL migration and a starter implementation of compute_model_reliance (Python) with unit tests.

Which of these would you like next?

Create another epic which expands the current functionality of admin portal where by wr have a total erratic feedback count on the admin portal Home page when user clicks on it, it directs to model evaluation performance page and list down all those records for which the count was showing as erratic feedback 
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 Here’s a cleanly structured Epic for your new requirement:

Epic: Expand Admin Portal – Erratic Feedback Count & Drill-down Navigation
Epic ID: ADM-EPIC-ERR-002
Owner: (Admin Portal / Model Monitoring Team)
Stakeholders: Product Owner, Data Engineering, Backend, Frontend (Admin Portal), QA, Analytics

Summary
Enhance the Admin Portal by introducing an Erratic Feedback Count card on the Home Page.
When users click this count, they are redirected to the Model Evaluation Performance page, filtered to display all records marked as “erratic feedback.”

This provides stakeholders with a high-level KPI on feedback anomalies while enabling drill-down to specific records for root-cause analysis.

Goals
Display total erratic feedback count prominently on Admin Portal Home.

Provide direct navigation to Model Evaluation Performance page filtered by erratic feedback records.

Ensure consistency between the count displayed on the Home page and the list of records shown after drill-down.

Enable stakeholders to quickly track and investigate erratic feedback cases.

Scope
In-scope

Backend: Aggregate erratic feedback count.

Frontend: Add KPI card on Admin Portal Home, clickable with redirect.

Model Evaluation Performance page: Add filtering support for erratic_feedback.

Ensure filters work with other metrics (request type, reporting month, request location, date range).

Out-of-scope

Defining “erratic feedback” logic (assumes flag already exists in DB).

Enhancing feedback classification logic (only display & drill-down functionality).

Acceptance Criteria
Home Page Card

A KPI card titled “Erratic Feedback” is shown on Admin Portal Home.

It displays the total count of erratic feedback records within the selected time range (default: last 30 days).

Clickable Navigation

Clicking the card redirects user to Model Evaluation Performance page.

The page is pre-filtered to show only erratic_feedback = true records.

Consistency

Count on the Home Page matches the number of rows returned on the Model Evaluation Performance page (for the same filters).

Filters

Default filters (reporting month, request type, request location, date range) apply to erratic feedback counts.

Users can modify filters on the Model Evaluation page to widen/narrow results.

UI/UX

KPI card styled consistently with other dashboard metrics (rounded corners, shadow, trend indicator).

Tooltip: “Total count of erratic feedback cases flagged by evaluation logic.”

Testing

Unit tests for count calculation API.

Integration tests validating card ↔ drill-down navigation.

Manual test case: card count equals table rows.
