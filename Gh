Dear Team,

We are excited to announce GSC Got Talent and encourage everyone to participate! You can showcase your talent in singing, dancing, stand-up comedy, beatboxing, hosting, or any other performance art. This is your chance to shine, whether solo or as a team!

Please send your nominations to Deepti by 25th October. The prelims will take place between 4th to 25th November (dates to be communicated soon).

Feel free to reach out to me for any queries. Let’s make this event memorable—don’t miss out!

Best regards,
