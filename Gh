If I use pii from azure and select email and phone no
ChatGPT said:
If you're using Azure‚Äôs PII detection (e.g., Azure AI Language Service), and you configure it to extract email addresses and phone numbers, here‚Äôs how it applies:

‚úÖ What this means:

Azure‚Äôs PII detection can automatically locate and classify sensitive information like:

Email addresses

Phone numbers

You can enable detection of these entity types when making requests.

The service will mask or tag these PII elements in text (e.g., replace phone numbers with a token or remove them), depending on your configured action.

‚ö°Ô∏èExample Usage
Request:
If you call the Azure Text Analytics PII endpoint with entity category constraints for EmailAddress and PhoneNumber, you‚Äôll get a response like:

{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "redactedText": "Please call me at [PhoneNumber] or email at [EmailAddress].",
      "entities": [
        {
          "text": "555-123-4567",
          "category": "PhoneNumber",
          "offset": 18,
          "length": 12,
          "confidenceScore": 0.99
        },
        {
          "text": "john.doe@example.com",
          "category": "EmailAddress",
          "offset": 38,
          "length": 20,
          "confidenceScore": 0.99
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Configuration Tip:
In the Azure AI Language service request, you can specify domain or entity filter to focus exclusively on phone numbers and email addresses.

The redact mode can remove or mask these entities.

‚ö°Ô∏èImplication for Your Model Simulation Use Case
If your input data contains PII:

You can preprocess it by calling the Azure PII detection service.

Redact or tag phone numbers and emails prior to:

Model evaluation

Export

Visualization

This allows you to protect sensitive information and stay compliant with privacy policies.

If you want, I can also show you a sample Azure REST call or help you write an Azure SDK snippet for extracting just phone numbers and email addresses! Would you like that?

How do you manage 7 types email, phone no. Email etc and then give a final single score
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî you're touching on a common challenge in PII detection and redaction scoring, especially when multiple types of PII (e.g., email, phone, address, ID number) are involved. Let me break down how you can manage and compute a final single score from multiple PII types.

üöÄ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify & Classify PII Entities
You start with Azure‚Äôs PII detection (or any PII detection tool) that outputs entities like:

EmailAddress

PhoneNumber

Address

Person

BankAccountNumber

CreditCardNumber

SSN (or government ID)

Each detected entity usually comes with:
‚úÖ text (what was found)
‚úÖ category (type of PII)
‚úÖ confidenceScore (0‚Äì1)

üöÄ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Normalize Scores per Type
Since different types of PII have different risks or importance, assign weights per type.

üìå Example (you define these based on risk, compliance needs, or business rules):

PII Type	Weight
EmailAddress	0.1
PhoneNumber	0.1
Address	0.2
Person	0.15
BankAccountNumber	0.2
CreditCardNumber	0.15
SSN / ID Number	0.1
üöÄ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate the Scores
üëâ For each document or data sample:

Count or sum the confidence scores for each type.

Multiply by the weight.

Combine into a single score.

‚ö° Example Formula:

Final Score
=
‚àë
(
weight of type
)
√ó
(
average or max confidence score for that type
)
Final Score=‚àë(weight of type)√ó(average or max confidence score for that type)
If you had:

2 emails (0.99, 0.95) ‚Üí avg 0.97

1 phone (0.98)

1 credit card (0.94)

Then:

=
0.1
√ó
0.97
+
0.1
√ó
0.98
+
0.15
√ó
0.94
=0.1√ó0.97+0.1√ó0.98+0.15√ó0.94
=
0.097
+
0.098
+
0.141
=0.097+0.098+0.141
=
0.336
=0.336
You can scale this (e.g. √ó100) or leave it between 0‚Äì1.

üöÄ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative: Use coverage-based scoring
Instead of confidence scores, you could define a rule like:

% of expected PII types detected = final score

Or % of tokens redacted = final score

üìù Example Final Output
Document ID	Final PII Score
Doc1	0.336
Doc2	0.452
‚ö† What to Watch
‚úÖ Make sure your weights reflect real risk or compliance needs.
‚úÖ Decide how to handle low-confidence detections (e.g., threshold of 0.8+).
‚úÖ Be consistent in aggregation logic ‚Äî average vs. max vs. sum.

If you'd like, I can:

Help you define a Python function / SQL query to compute this.

Suggest a better weighting scheme based on regulatory priorities (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA).

You said:
I need to add columns to a dataframe it should have same rows it has just should join on the basis of a column with another dataframe 
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî you have two dataframes:

df1: Main DF

df2: DF with additional columns

You want to add columns from df2 into df1 where a certain column (let‚Äôs call it key_col) matches, keeping the same rows as in df1. This is just a merge or join.

Here‚Äôs how you do it in pandas:

‚úÖ Example
import pandas as pd

# df1: Original DF
# df2: DF with columns to add
# Both have a common column: 'key_col'

merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='key_col', how='left')
on='key_col' ‚Üí The common column.

how='left' ‚Üí Keep all rows from df1 (even if no match in df2).

Result: merged_df has all columns from df1 + matching columns from df2.

‚ö°Ô∏è Key Notes
‚úÖ Ensures same row order and count as df1.
‚úÖ Will fill NaN if no match in df2.
‚úÖ Doesn‚Äôt duplicate rows unless key_col has duplicates in df2.
‚ÄÉ‚Äì If this is an issue, deduplicate or aggregate df2 first.

üíª Quick Demo
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'user_id': [1, 2, 3],
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol']
})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'user_id': [1, 2],
    'email': ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com']
})
# Merge
merged = df1.merge(df2, on='user_id', how='left')
print(merged)
Result:

   user_id  name   email
0        1  Alice  alice@example.com
1        2    Bob    bob@example.com
2        3  Carol           NaN
If you want, I can also help you optimize the merge, add suffixes for overlapping columns, or even write a quick function for this! Would you like that? üôÇ

You said:
I am doing sent_tokenise to divide a sentence and then taking embeddings for each sentence is it going to load too many embeddings 
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question ‚Äî you‚Äôre right to be cautious here! Let‚Äôs break down how this affects embedding usage:

‚ö°Ô∏è What Happens When You Do sent_tokenize() + Embeddings
Suppose your original text has N sentences.

After sent_tokenize(), you have N smaller strings.

You call the embedding model N times ‚Äî yielding N embeddings.

‚úÖ This means:

If you had 1 long text yielding 1 embedding, you now have N embeddings.

The total embedding count goes from 1 ‚ûî N, which can:

Increase memory usage (you now have an array of embeddings).

Increase cost (embedding APIs typically charge per request).

Impact speed (embedding requests will be N times longer if done sequentially).

‚ö°Ô∏è Is This a Bad Practice? Not Always
It depends on your use case:

üëç If you want sentence-level search or analysis:
It's valid and common practice. Enables precise retrieval and context understanding.

üëé If you just want an embedding of the whole text:
It's wasteful. You're multiplying cost and load unnecessarily.

‚ö°Ô∏è What You Can Do
‚úÖ Batch Embeddings:
Send sentences in a batch request if your embedding service supports it (reduces network overhead).

‚úÖ Sentence Aggregation:
If needed, average or pool embeddings (average, max, CLS) after extracting individual embeddings.

‚úÖ Use a Model with Longer Context:
Modern embeddings (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-3) can encode long text directly.

‚úÖ Assess Granularity Needs:
Only use sentence-level embeddings if you truly need that level of detail.

‚ö°Ô∏è Summary
You‚Äôll have as many embeddings as you have sentences.

This may be ideal for fine-grained retrieval, but it increases cost and storage.

Evaluate if you really need this granularity, or if one embedding per chunk or per document suffices.

If you want, I can also help you implement an efficient batching method, or design an embedding strategy (sentence vs. chunk vs. whole text). Would you like that? üôÇ

You said:
I am then doing exactly this for two piece of text and then calculating similarity is there a better way to do it
ChatGPT said:
Excellent context ‚Äî thanks for clarifying! So right now your approach is:

‚úÖ Split Text A ‚ûî sent_tokenize() ‚ûî embed every sentence
‚úÖ Split Text B ‚ûî sent_tokenize() ‚ûî embed every sentence
‚úÖ Compare every sentence in A vs every sentence in B ‚ûî similarity

Result: Very fine-grained, but potentially:

Costly (many embeddings),

Slower (many comparisons),

Sometimes too fragmented (you only care about overall similarity).

‚ö°Ô∏è What Might Be Better?
üéØ 1Ô∏è‚É£ If You Need Overall Similarity Between Two Texts
Use an embedding model on the entire text (or on larger, semantically meaningful chunks), then compare:

Single embedding per text ‚ûî Cosine similarity.
‚úÖ Simple, efficient.

üéØ 2Ô∏è‚É£ If You Need Granular Insights (Sentence-Level Similarity)
Keep the current approach, but:

Aggregate results. For example:

Identify top matching sentences

Or average the best matching scores

Or use max similarity across pairs
‚úÖ This gives the best of both worlds.

üéØ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chunking for Longer Texts
If texts are long, embed in moderately-sized chunks (hundreds of tokens), not individual sentences:
‚úÖ Reduces total embeddings drastically.
‚úÖ Maintains context better than single sentences.

‚ö°Ô∏è Summary
If you only care about overall similarity ‚ûî Embed the whole text.

If you need detailed overlap ‚ûî Sentence embeddings, but aggregate results wisely.

If texts are long ‚ûî Chunk, embed, and compare chunk embeddings.

If you want, I can help you:

üëá Build a quick embedding and similarity example for any approach.

You said:
Yes give me few examples
ChatGPT said:
Excellent! Here are a few concrete examples you can use for text similarity, depending on your use case. All examples assume you‚Äôre working in Python with a popular embedding model (e.g., sentence-transformers or OpenAI embeddings).

ü•á 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Case: One Embedding per Text
Use when you just want overall similarity.
Best for short‚Äìmedium texts (one embedding captures the whole context).

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')  # example model

text1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
text2 = "A fast brown fox leaps over a sleeping dog."

embedding1 = model.encode(text1)
embedding2 = model.encode(text2)

similarity_score = cosine_similarity([embedding1], [embedding2])[0][0]
print(f"Overall Similarity: {similarity_score:.4f}")
ü•à 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sentence-by-Sentence Similarity
Use when you want to compare individual sentences.
Results in a similarity matrix.

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import nltk

nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')

text1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It's a classic example."
text2 = "A fast brown fox leaps over a sleeping dog. This sentence is popular."

sentences1 = sent_tokenize(text1)
sentences2 = sent_tokenize(text2)

embeddings1 = model.encode(sentences1)
embeddings2 = model.encode(sentences2)

similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings1, embeddings2)

import pandas as pd
results = pd.DataFrame(similarity_matrix, index=sentences1, columns=sentences2)

print("Sentence Similarity Matrix:\n", results)
‚úÖ Quickly spot best matching sentences across documents.

ü•â 3Ô∏è‚É£ Chunking Large Texts
Use when texts are too long for a single embedding.
Break into chunks (~250‚Äì500 tokens), embed, and then compare.

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=250):
    words = text.split()
    for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size):
        yield ' '.join(words[i:i + chunk_size])

text1 = "LONG_TEXT_1..."
text2 = "LONG_TEXT_2..."

chunks1 = list(chunk_text(text1))
chunks2 = list(chunk_text(text2))

embedding1 = model.encode(chunks1)
embedding2 = model.encode(chunks2)

similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)

# Example: Get the best match across chunks
import numpy as np
best_score = np.max(similarity_matrix)

print(f"Best chunk similarity between the texts: {best_score:.4f}")

# Optional: Aggregate statistics
avg_score = np.mean(similarity_matrix)
print(f"Average chunk similarity: {avg_score:.4f}")

‚ö°Ô∏è Summary Table
Method	Best for
Single Embedding	Short‚Äìmedium texts, overall similarity
Sentence-level	Granular comparisons (sentences match across texts)
Chunking	Long texts, captures context across sections
If you want, I can also help you:
‚úÖ Wrap this in a reusable function.
‚úÖ Show how to incorporate thresholds (e.g., ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù if >0.8).
‚úÖ Demo with Hugging Face or OpenAI embeddings.

We want this epic to proceed because we have been constantly consuming our IT teams effort to get the results and disturbing rhe prod data to do the calculations again and again but when model simulation will be in place it can be done in that controlled environment with the production data
ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a crisp way you can justify and state this in the business case for your epic:

‚ö°Ô∏è Business Justification for Model Simulation Epic
"We‚Äôve been repeatedly consuming valuable IT team effort and impacting the production environment to run ad hoc model evaluations and calculations. This approach is costly, intrusive, and increases the risk of affecting live services.

With the Model Simulation and Evaluation Framework in place:
‚úÖ We can run experiments in a controlled, isolated environment using actual production data,
‚úÖ Minimize disruption to the live environment,
‚úÖ Avoid repeated manual data pulls and calculations,
‚úÖ Maintain consistency and reproducibility of evaluation results, and
‚úÖ Accelerate the cycle for model experimentation and improvement.

In short: This epic will enable safe, cost-efficient, and rapid evaluation of new or updated models, making AI/ML iteration seamless and reducing operational overhead for IT and data engineering teams."
