I just spoke with Eileen and Deric regarding the countries filter implementation. According to Deric, the solution using a static backend table containing the list of countries fulfills the requirements and has Jonâ€™s approval as well.

The team chose this approach since dynamically adding countries to the filter was considerably more complex and would have consumed more time and effort. Everyone agreed that the static backend table is both efficient and acceptable for our current needs.
