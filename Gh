6. Governance
The ongoing monitoring plan must define a clear governance structure, outlining roles and responsibilities to ensure effective, timely monitoring and oversight through appropriate forums.

6.1 Governance Structure
The governance of RMC Risk Management Copilot monitoring follows a structured approach, involving key stakeholders to ensure accountability and continuous oversight.

Role	Responsibility
Model Monitoring Team	Conducts ongoing monitoring, tracks key performance metrics, and generates periodic reports.
Risk Management Role Holders	Review model-generated outputs, validate structured data, and provide feedback on usability.
AI Governance Team	Ensures adherence to risk policies, compliance guidelines, and AI ethics principles.
Executive Oversight (Risk Committee)	Reviews monitoring reports and approves necessary mitigation actions.
6.2 Governance Forums
Monthly Monitoring Review: The Model Monitoring Team presents performance insights and risk trends to the AI Governance Team.

Quarterly Risk Committee Review: Critical performance degradation cases are escalated for discussion and decision-making.

Ad-hoc Escalation Meetings: In cases of severe degradation (e.g., consecutive red alerts in critical metrics), an immediate review is conducted.

7. Escalation Plan
The ongoing monitoring plan must define a structured escalation process and mitigation strategy for poorly rated metrics to ensure timely interventions.

7.1 Escalation Process for Poorly Rated Metrics
Metrics rated Amber or Red trigger an escalation, ensuring that necessary actions are taken before performance issues impact business processes.

Escalation Level	Trigger Condition	Action Required
Level 1 (Warning)	Amber alert (50-69%)	Investigation by Model Monitoring Team; validation of affected responses.
Level 2 (Review Required)	Consecutive Amber alerts for a metric	AI Governance Team conducts root cause analysis; feedback gathered from users.
Level 3 (Critical Alert)	Red alert (0-49%) for any metric	Immediate escalation to Risk Committee; mitigation plan implementation.
7.2 Mitigation Strategy
If a metric enters the Red Zone (0-49%), the following corrective actions are initiated:

Root Cause Analysis: Identify model-related issues (e.g., prompt misalignment, data inconsistencies).

Model Adjustment: If needed, adjust prompt engineering, retrain model components, or introduce additional user validation steps.

Threshold Review: If business requirements evolve, recalibrate thresholds based on updated performance expectations.

Interim Manual Oversight: Implement temporary manual intervention for impacted use cases until resolution.

8. Monitoring Frequency
The ongoing monitoring plan must define the monitoring frequency, aligning with the use case complexity and risk tiering of the model.

8.1 Risk Tiering Alignment
The RMC Risk Management Copilot falls under moderate-risk AI applications, meaning that monitoring should be frequent enough to detect performance drifts but does not require real-time intervention unless a severe issue is detected.

Risk Tier	Monitoring Frequency
High-Risk AI (e.g., Credit Scoring Models)	Daily Monitoring
Moderate-Risk AI (e.g., RMC Copilot)	Weekly Performance Checks
Low-Risk AI (e.g., Informational Chatbots)	Monthly Monitoring
8.2 Monitoring Intervals
Automated Performance Tracking: Metrics are logged and visualized in real-time on the dashboard.

Weekly Review: Model Monitoring Team analyzes metric trends every week.

Quarterly Deep-Dive Assessment: AI Governance Team reviews overall trends, identifies systemic patterns, and recommends model adjustments.

Ad-Hoc Monitoring: If a red alert is triggered, an immediate review is conducted outside the scheduled monitoring cycle.
