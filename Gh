Unsolicited Abbreviation Expansion:**
The Generated Response must strictly adhere to the level of detail present in the Input Text regarding abbreviations.
**Rule:** If the Input Text contains an abbreviation (e.g., "ITR") *without* providing its full expansion, then the Generated Response *must not* add that full expansion (e.g., writing "Income Tax Return (ITR)").
**Action:** Carefully compare the Input Text and the Generated Response. Identify any instance where the Response includes the full name alongside an abbreviation (like "Full Name (Abbr)") ONLY IF the Input Text solely contained the abbreviation ("Abbr"). Such additions are considered errors and reduce accuracy, even if the expansion itself is factually correct. This is NOT about finding abbreviations that NEED expansion; it's about penalizing the ADDITION of expansions not present in the input.
