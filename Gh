Your task is to verify whether any abbreviation in the output has been expanded (e.g., "AI" â†’ "Artificial Intelligence") without that expansion being present in the input.

Instructions:
Carefully compare the input and output.

If the output includes an expanded form of an abbreviation (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence") that is not explicitly mentioned in the input, mark it as a hallucination.

Only expansions that are grounded in the input are acceptable.
