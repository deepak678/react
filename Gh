 Abbreviation Fidelity:** Verify all abbreviation expansions present in the Generated Response (e.g., instances like 'Full Phrase (Abbr)' or 'Abbr (Full Phrase)'). For each expansion found, check the original Input Text. If the Input Text contained the abbreviation (e.g., 'Abbr') but *did not* contain the corresponding 'Full Phrase' explicitly linked to it, then the expansion in the Generated Response is incorrect according to evaluation criteria. Such unsolicited expansions detract from accuracy.
Unsolicited Expansions:** Pay close attention to abbreviations. Identify any abbreviations in the Input Text. Now examine the Generated Response. If the Response provides the full textual expansion for an abbreviation that was *only* present as an abbreviation in the Input Text, mark this as a negative point or inaccuracy. The Response should only reflect expansions that were explicitly provided in the Input.
