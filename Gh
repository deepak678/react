Collaborative Enhancement via Admin Portal
Enhancing the existing Node.js admin portal requires contributors to have technical knowledge of Node.js and its stack.

This approach centralizes monitoring features, giving all teams a unified UI and experience, but collaboration barriers trend higher if other teams lack Node.js expertise.

Challenges include: codebase maintenance across teams with varying skillsets, risk of technical debt, and inconsistent application structure unless rigorous processes and documentation are enforced.

Administrative dashboards can offer flexible real-time features, but knowledge transfer and onboarding complexity can slow down the process for non-Node.js developers.

Shared Data Layer with Authorized Views
By exposing the data layer or view via APIs/streams, other teams can integrate model monitoring into their own dashboards leveraging their familiar platforms (such as Grafana, Streamlit, PowerBI, or proprietary monitoring tools).

Benefits include: minimal changes to existing UI frameworks, improved agility, and ease of adoption for vertical teams with differing technical stacks.

This architecture reduces network integration points, eliminates data duplication, and supports scalability and modularity, with open APIs allowing plug-and-play installation across platforms.

Drawbacks: possible increased coupling between data sources and consumers, security risks due to data exposure, and more complexity in managing data governance and authorization.
