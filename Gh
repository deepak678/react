I have been a key contributor to multiple high-impact initiatives, particularly in building and enabling model monitoring capabilities across critical programs. I independently designed and implemented the Model Monitoring Framework for RMC — a mandatory requirement to secure MRM approval — which was essential for the model to progress to production. I also played a vital role in establishing and running the monitoring processes for ADA, and I am currently driving the same effort for Luma, ensuring these programs meet all governance standards for pilot and production rollout.

Throughout these engagements, I have collaborated closely with cross-functional stakeholders and multiple engineering, governance, and business teams to achieve our shared objectives. My contributions have directly supported the successful deployment and operationalization of key models while enhancing risk compliance and long-term sustainability of our solutions.
