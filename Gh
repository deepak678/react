Getting Started
Welcome to the Generative AI Model Monitoring Dashboard! This platform is designed to help you monitor and evaluate the performance of your generative AI models with ease.

Use the dashboard to:

Track key metrics like accuracy, completeness, and hallucination.
Gain insights into non-functional metrics such as latency and robustness.
Experiment with model configurations in the Experimentation Zone.
Log errors and provide feedback to improve model performance.
FAQs
1. What are Functional and Non-Functional Metrics?

Functional Metrics:
Functional metrics measure the quality of the outputs generated by the model in terms of correctness, completeness, and relevance. These metrics assess how well the model fulfills its intended purpose.

Examples:

Accuracy: How often the model's output is correct.
Completeness: The degree to which the model's output fully satisfies the query or prompt.
Hallucination: Instances where the model generates incorrect or fabricated information not supported by the context or data.
Non-Functional Metrics:
Non-functional metrics measure the performance and operational aspects of the model. These assess how well the system operates under various conditions, including efficiency, stability, and resource usage.

Examples:

Latency: The time taken to generate a response.
Robustness: How well the model handles diverse inputs, including edge cases.
Stability: The consistency of the modelâ€™s performance over time.
2. What are the ISTQB Definitions for Accuracy, Completeness, and Hallucination?

Accuracy (ISTQB Definition):
"The degree to which the actual outcomes of a test or operation match the expected results."
In AI, this refers to how correctly the model performs the task, producing reliable and valid outputs.

Completeness (ISTQB Definition):
"The degree to which all intended functionality or data is present in the software or system."
In generative AI, it measures whether the output comprehensively addresses the input prompt or question.

Hallucination (AI-Specific Definition):
Hallucination occurs when a model generates content that is factually incorrect or nonsensical relative to the given context. Reducing hallucination is key to improving the trustworthiness of AI systems.

3. Why Are Functional Metrics Important for AI Models?
Functional metrics like accuracy and completeness ensure that the AI system delivers reliable and usable outputs, critical for tasks requiring high precision (e.g., medical diagnostics, financial predictions).

4. Why Do Non-Functional Metrics Matter?
Non-functional metrics, such as latency and robustness, ensure that the system is scalable, responsive, and able to handle real-world conditions, which is essential for user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
