How ADA Use Case Differs from RMC
In RMC, all metrics are calculated in real time.

In ADA, metrics are calculated both in real-time and via batch processing.

ADA interacts with the ASK RC data platform and the R&C Gen AI platform for data access and processing.

Inputs come from multiple platforms, but final calculations occur within the Gen AI platform.

Final results are then surfaced as views available across platforms.
