When we have a use case which is working on gpt 4 and we want to upgrade.to gpt 4o how much population of data should be verified again to give it a go ahead
ChatGPT said:
When migrating a use case from GPT-4 to GPT-4o, the goal is to ensure that GPT-4o either matches or improves upon the existing system’s performance across your key evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, completeness, hallucination rate, etc.).

✅ General Recommendation for Validation Sample Size
There’s no strict universal number, but here’s a pragmatic approach based on industry practices in LLM evaluation:

1. Minimum Validation Sample Size
Small-scale, low-risk use cases: Validate with 50–100 representative prompts/responses.

Medium to high-risk use cases (e.g., regulated domains, customer-facing tools): Use 300–500 samples.

Critical use cases (e.g., financial decisions, medical support, legal content): 1000+ samples recommended.

2. Stratified Sampling Strategy
Instead of randomly sampling the whole dataset, split it by:

Intent types or task categories

Edge cases or complex prompts

High-usage or high-risk flows

Then, sample proportionately from each group to ensure full coverage of your use case space.

3. Evaluation Approach
Automated Metrics (if available): Use hallucination detectors, similarity scoring, etc.

Human Evaluation: For a representative subset (10–20%), especially where nuance matters.

Two-model comparison: Run the same inputs through GPT-4 and GPT-4o and compare outputs side by side.

4. Go/No-Go Criteria
Give the green light for GPT-4o if:

Performance is equal or better on ≥95% of tested samples.

There’s no regression in critical tasks (hallucinations, compliance, accuracy).

Users or evaluators prefer GPT-4o outputs in blind A/B tests.

Summary Table
Use Case Risk Level	Recommended Validation Size	Notes
Low-risk / internal	50–100 samples	Focus on regression checks
Medium-risk	300–500 samples	Include edge cases
High-risk / critical	1000+ samples	Add human eval + fail-safe logic

Any approach to pick up sampling size based on output of a specific metric like accuracy completeness hallucination context relevance
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can determine sampling size based on metric-driven evaluation using statistical sampling techniques, especially when measuring output quality in terms of metrics like accuracy, completeness, hallucination, and context relevance.

Here’s how you can approach this:

1. Use a Proportions-Based Sampling Formula
For binary or percentage-based metrics (e.g., accuracy, hallucination rate), use:

n
=
Z
2
⋅
p
⋅
(
1
−
p
)
E
2
n= 
E 
2
 
Z 
2
 ⋅p⋅(1−p)
​
 
Where:

n = sample size

Z = Z-score (confidence level)

1.96 for 95% confidence

p = estimated proportion (from pilot run or historical GPT-4 results)

E = desired margin of error (e.g., 0.05 = ±5%)

2. Example: Sampling for Accuracy Metric
Let’s say GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, and you want to check if GPT-4o achieves the same (±5% margin, 95% confidence):

n
=
(
1.96
)
2
⋅
0.8
⋅
(
1
−
0.8
)
0.05
2
=
246
n= 
0.05 
2
 
(1.96) 
2
 ⋅0.8⋅(1−0.8)
​
 =246
So you’d need to evaluate ~250 samples for that metric alone.

3. Extend to Multiple Metrics
If evaluating multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, hallucination, completeness):

Estimate sample size for each metric independently (they may differ).

Take the largest required sample size among them as your baseline.

Or apply stratified sampling and evaluate different subsets for different metrics if resources are limited.

4. When You Don’t Know p Yet
If you haven’t run a baseline yet, use the most conservative estimate:

Assume p = 0.5 (maximum variance).

This yields:

n
=
(
1.96
)
2
⋅
0.5
⋅
(
1
−
0.5
)
0.05
2
≈
384
n= 
0.05 
2
 
(1.96) 
2
 ⋅0.5⋅(1−0.5)
​
 ≈384
So, 384 samples covers most metrics conservatively with 95% confidence.

5. Optional: Sequential or Adaptive Sampling
Instead of fixing n upfront:

Start with 100–150 samples.

Track metric variance and convergence trends.

Increase sample size until results stabilize (e.g., <1–2% change per 50 samples).

Would you like a small Python script that calculates this based on your metric values and confidence level?

I need to list down activities that needed to be done and input I need from the team to start conducting model evaluation for mvp2 in mvp 1 as you know we have done it for issue rewriting for helios we have created model monitoring metrics like accuracy completeness hallucination context relevance semantic relevance we have also calculated efficiency in terms of total time saved average feedback score total erratic feedback 
Some points I want you to consider are prompts for evaluation might need to change as per change in the functionality of different features included calculate non functional metrics like throughput include metrics from content moderation pii jailbreaking add extra filters in the dashboard like user or other relevant filters and good graphs to show some trends in an easy to interpret manner

Here's a structured list of activities and inputs needed from the team to begin model evaluation for MVP 2, considering your MVP 1 experience and the new directions you're moving in:

Activities for MVP 2 Model Evaluation
1. Define Scope and Objectives
Identify new/updated features to evaluate.

List evaluation goals (e.g., detect regressions, validate improvements, test against jailbreaks).

Define critical vs. optional metrics.

2. Prompt & Evaluation Design
Revise or create new prompts aligned with changed functionality.

Segment prompts by feature (e.g., summarization, rewriting, moderation).

Create ground truth/reference outputs (for accuracy, completeness, etc.).

Prepare adversarial/jailbreaking test cases.

3. Update Metric Framework
Reuse existing metrics: accuracy, completeness, hallucination, context relevance, semantic relevance.

Add new:

Non-functional: throughput (requests/sec), latency, time saved, compute cost.

Moderation: PII leakage detection, jailbreak attempts, toxicity score, bias.

Redefine metric thresholds or benchmarks if model version or functionality has changed.

4. Data & Sampling Strategy
Define datasets for:

Regression prompts from MVP1.

New prompts for updated functionality.

Edge cases/adversarial prompts.

Define sample sizes per metric (based on statistical confidence or metric volatility).

Implement stratified sampling by feature, user type, or usage patterns.

5. Feedback Loop Setup
Collect human feedback where needed.

Score outputs using LLM-as-judge or evaluator pipelines.

Allow feedback on quality, usefulness, and failures (erratic or misaligned outputs).

6. Dashboard and Visualization Enhancements
Add filters for:

User

Feature/Module

Time Period

Feedback rating

Add charts for:

Metric trend over time (line/bar)

Error categories distribution (pie)

Feedback score histograms

Prompt distribution by feature

Build anomaly detection (e.g., spikes in hallucination or PII leakage).

7. Review & Governance
Schedule regular review of evaluation findings.

Define criteria for Go/No-Go or rollback.

Create reporting for stakeholders.
