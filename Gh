. Text Vectorization
Convert text into TF‑IDF vectors (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency), which represent the importance of each word in a response relative to all responses.

3. Similarity Measurement
Use cosine similarity between each LLM vector and each human vector.

Cosine similarity ranges from 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical).

4. Matching Approaches
We used two main styles depending on the requirement:

Greedy Best Match — for each row from one dataset, find the highest similarity match in the other dataset (allows duplicates).
