In the evaluation of the Large Language Model (LLM), several key evaluation metrics were calculated to assess the model's performance across various dimensions:

Accuracy

Completeness

Hallucination

Context Relevance

Semantic Relevance

To better understand the model's performance, thresholds were established for each metric, and a color-coding scheme was applied. The color-coded results are summarized in the attached sheet, providing a clear visual representation of the model's performance across the metrics.

Thresholds and Color-Coding Scheme
The following color-coding scheme was applied to each metric:

Green: Indicates optimal performance, where the model exceeds the defined threshold for the metric.

Yellow: Indicates moderate performance, suggesting areas that meet the threshold but could benefit from improvements.

Red: Denotes poor performance, highlighting metrics that need significant attention and improvement.

Purple: Identifies overconfidence in the model’s output, indicating high confidence or certainty in the model’s answers that may be unwarranted or incorrect.

Interpretation of Color-Coded Results
By analyzing the color-coded metrics, the following insights can be drawn:

Strengths: Metrics in green signify areas where the model performs well.

Areas for Improvement: Metrics in yellow indicate moderate performance, suggesting that further optimization could enhance these areas.

Critical Issues: Metrics in red point to performance gaps that require immediate attention.

Overconfidence: Purple metrics highlight instances where the model demonstrates unwarranted confidence, suggesting that its certainty is not aligned with the quality of the output.

The color-coded feedback provides a visual summary of the LLM's performance, helping to identify strengths and weaknesses quickly. This will guide future improvements and refinements to ensure the model meets the desired standards for real-world applications.
