Subject: Request for Feedback on Evaluation Criteria and Scores

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am attaching a prompt we are currently using for evaluation purposes. We kindly request your feedback on whether the definitions we are using for the metrics and the evaluation criteria we are seeking align with your expectations.

Additionally, we have calculated scores for three metrics—accuracy, completeness, and hallucination—which are presented in the attached evaluation sheet. To make the analysis clearer:

Deviations: Instances where there is a deviation of more than 1 in any of the scores are highlighted.
Revised Responses: For cases where our scores are lower than the scores provided during manual testing, we have generated revised responses, which are included in the second sheet of the attachment.
Furthermore, after revising the definition of hallucination, we could not detect any instances of it. We request you to review this aspect in the provided prompt as well.

Please let us know if any clarifications or assistance are needed from our side.

Looking forward to your feedback.
