I’m keen to understand what do you think skills and traits are most valued. Given that as I will progress in my career the top of the pyramid is quite selective, what would you advise I focus on developing to best prepare myself for those opportunities?”


With the significant contributions I’ve made in our GenAI efforts and the specialized skills I bring to the team, do you see these strengths being recognized in the next appraisal cycle? I’d appreciate your perspective on how expertise in such a niche field is factored into growth opportunities and recognitions at this level.
