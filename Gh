For both POC B and POC C, after exploring various approaches, I wasn't able to identify any alternative methods that would yield significantly different results. The outcomes I obtained are in alignment with the results the rest of the team has been seeing.

Specifically for POC C, the summarization of documents works well when the objective is to generate a concise summary. However, when trying to assess the completeness of the document based on the summary, the results are not satisfactory. The method doesnâ€™t reliably indicate whether key content is missing or incomplete.
