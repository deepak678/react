**Accuracy Evaluation Rule:**
- The output must **not** modify abbreviations unless they were already expanded in the input.
- If an abbreviation is **not expanded in the input** but **expanded in the output**, apply a penalty.
- The accuracy score should reflect this inconsistency, as the model is introducing additional information.
