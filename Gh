Epic: Expand Admin Portal – Erratic Feedback Count & Drill-down Navigation

Epic ID: ADM-EPIC-ERR-002
Owner: (Admin Portal / Model Monitoring Team)
Stakeholders: Product Owner, Data Engineering, Backend, Frontend (Admin Portal), QA, Analytics

Summary

Enhance the Admin Portal by introducing an Erratic Feedback Count card on the Home Page.
When users click this count, they are redirected to the Model Evaluation Performance page, filtered to display all records marked as “erratic feedback.”

This provides stakeholders with a high-level KPI on feedback anomalies while enabling drill-down to specific records for root-cause analysis.
