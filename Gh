Requirement: Recalculate and Export NLP Evaluation Metrics1.  ObjectiveThe objective of this requirement is to recalculate four key Natural Language Processing (NLP) evaluation metrics – Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance – for existing data using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.  Previous calculations were performed using the GPT-4o model. The recalculated metrics will replace the existing values. The results will be exported to an Excel file for review and analysis.
2.  Background* Currently, Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance scores are calculated for a specific dataset using the GPT-4o model.
* There is a need to evaluate these metrics using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to assess its performance and compare it to the GPT-4o model.
* The results of this evaluation will inform decisions regarding model selection and potential improvements to the NLP pipeline.
3.  ScopeThis requirement includes the following:

* **3.1 Metric Recalculation:**
    * Recalculate the Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance metrics for the designated dataset.
    * Utilize the Gemini 1.5 Pro model for the metric calculation process.
    * Ensure the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is correctly integrated and configured to perform these calculations.
    * The exact methodology for calculating each metric (Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance) should remain consistent with the previous implementation using GPT-4o, with the exception of the model used for the evaluation. If any changes to the methodology are necessary due to the Gemini 1.5 Pro model, these changes must be documented and approved.
* **3.2 Data Replacement:**
    * Replace the existing metric values (Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance) in the data storage system with the newly calculated values from the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.
    * Ensure data integrity during the replacement process.
    * The data storage location (e.g., database table, file path) of the existing metric values is: [Specify Data Storage Location - e.g., "Table: 'nlp_evaluation_results', Schema: 'production'"].
* **3.3 Data Export:**
    * Export the recalculated metric data, including the associated data identifiers (e.g., record IDs, document IDs), into an Excel (.xlsx) file.
    * The Excel file should include the following columns:
        * Data Identifier (e.g., `record_id`, `document_id`)
        * Accuracy (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
        * Completeness (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
        * Hallucination (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
        * Semantic Relevance (Gemini 1.5 Pro)
    * The Excel file should be saved to a designated location: [Specify Export Location - e.g., "/path/to/exports/gemini_metric_evaluation.xlsx"].
    * The file name should be descriptive and include the model name (Gemini 1.5 Pro).
4.  Out of Scope* Modifying the underlying data used for metric calculation (the input data).
* Developing new metrics beyond Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance.
* Automating the review process of the exported Excel file.
5.  Acceptance Criteria* **AC01: Metric Recalculation Accuracy:**
    * Given the designated dataset and the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.
    * When the metric recalculation process is complete.
    * Then the calculated Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, and Semantic Relevance scores are generated for all data points in the dataset.
    * And the calculated metrics are consistent with the defined calculation methodology.
* **AC02: Data Replacement Success:**
    * Given the original data storage location and the newly calculated metrics.
    * When the data replacement process is complete.
    * Then the original metric values in the data storage location are replaced with the new Gemini 1.5 Pro calculated values.
    * And the data integrity of the storage location is maintained (no data loss or corruption).
* **AC03: Excel Export Completeness:**
    * Given the recalculated metric data.
    * When the data export process is complete.
    * Then an Excel file is generated at the specified location.
    * And the Excel file contains all the recalculated metrics (Accuracy, Completeness, Hallucination, Semantic Relevance) and corresponding data identifiers.
    * And the Excel file is formatted as specified in Section 3.3.
* **AC04: Data Consistency:**
    * Given the original data and the recalculated metrics.
    * When the exported excel file is reviewed.
    * Then, the recalculated metrics in the excel file are consistent with the data used for calculation.
