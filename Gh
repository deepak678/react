Apply Threshold Logic to Average Feedback Score

Implement color coding for average feedback scores based on the following thresholds:

Score Range	Color
1.0 ‚Äì 2.4	üî¥ Red
2.5 ‚Äì 3.4	üü† Amber
3.5 ‚Äì 4.4	üü¢ Green
4.5 ‚Äì 5.0	üü£ Purple (Overconfidence)

Graph Enhancements (As per PPT Slide 2):

Line Graphs for Metrics:

Create individual line graphs for each metric.

Add threshold reference lines (only for Red and Green ranges).

Update Histograms:

Modify existing histogram charts to reflect color coding based on the metric thresholds.

Default Filter Change:

Modify the default date filter on the dashboard to show data for the last 7 days only.

Model Performance Evaluation Enhancements:

Add overall performance score to the Model Performance Evaluation page.

Display the average of overall performance scores on the Home page.

Apply the following thresholds to the overall performance score:

Score Range	Color
0.00 ‚Äì 0.47	üî¥ Red
0.48 ‚Äì 0.67	üü† Amber
0.68 ‚Äì 0.97	üü¢ Green
> 0.97	üü£ Purple (Overconfidence)

Effort Estimation Items:
Line Graph Development

Create line graphs for each metric.

Add Red/Green threshold reference lines.

Histogram Color Updates

Modify existing histogram visuals to follow the new threshold-based coloring logic.

Default Date Filter Change

Update filter logic to set ‚Äúlast week‚Äù as the default view.
