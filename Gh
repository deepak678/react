Context Relevance Scoring Framework (Mapped to 1-5 Scale)
Score (1-5)	Cosine Similarity Range (Sim)	Criteria
5 (Excellent)	Sim ≥ 0.85	The retrieved context is highly relevant to the query. Covers all key aspects with no irrelevant content.
4 (Good)	0.70 ≤ Sim < 0.85	The context is mostly relevant, but some minor details are missing or slightly off-topic.
3 (Satisfactory)	0.50 ≤ Sim < 0.70	The context provides partial relevance. Some key details are missing, or minor unrelated content is present.
2 (Needs Improvement)	0.30 ≤ Sim < 0.50	The context is weakly relevant, missing crucial details or including a significant amount of irrelevant data.
1 (Poor)	Sim < 0.30	The context is completely misaligned with the query, either unrelated or failing to address key aspects.
