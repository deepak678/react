Input
Title: Server downtime
Description: The application experienced unexpected downtime due to server overload.
Previous Model Output (Baseline)
Field	Output
Condition	Server overload
Consequence	Application downtime
Context	During peak traffic hours
Criteria	Ensure server capacity meets demand
Cause	High concurrent requests
New Model Output
Field	Output
Condition	Server failure
Consequence	System unresponsive
Context	Peak hours
Criteria	Optimize server load balancing
Cause	Insufficient server resources
Comparison & Analysis
Field	Baseline Output	New Model Output	Assessment
Condition	Server overload	Server failure	Worse (Less specific)
Consequence	Application downtime	System unresponsive	Worse (Less descriptive)
Context	During peak traffic hours	Peak hours	Same
Criteria	Ensure server capacity meets demand	Optimize server load balancing	Better (More actionable)
Cause	High concurrent requests	Insufficient server resources	Better (More detailed cause)
Final Verdict: Mixed Performance
Worse: The condition and consequence are less precise in the new model.
Better: The criteria and cause give better insights into the issue.
✦ Overall Assessment: Needs Improvement (Some fields improved, but others became less specific).

Another Example: Performance Lag Issue
Input
Title: Performance lag
Description: Application response time increased to more than 10 seconds.
Previous Model Output (Baseline)
Field	Output
Condition	Slow response
Consequence	User dissatisfaction
Context	Under high load
Criteria	Optimize query performance
Cause	Unoptimized database queries
New Model Output
Field	Output
Condition	High latency issue
Consequence	Application slowdown
Context	During concurrent user activity
Criteria	Implement caching mechanisms
Cause	Excessive database load
Comparison & Analysis
Field	Baseline Output	New Model Output	Assessment
Condition	Slow response	High latency issue	Same
Consequence	User dissatisfaction	Application slowdown	Better (More specific)
Context	Under high load	During concurrent user activity	Better (More detailed context)
Criteria	Optimize query performance	Implement caching mechanisms	Better (New strategy introduced)
Cause	Unoptimized database queries	Excessive database load	Better (More precise diagnosis)
Final Verdict: Better
✦ Overall Assessment: Improved model performance (More detailed and actionable insights).

Conclusion
If the new model provides more precise outputs, it is marked as better.
If it generalizes too much or loses detail, it is marked as worse.
If there is no meaningful difference, it is marked as same.
