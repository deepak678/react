This section provides a high-level overview of the monitoring metrics used to evaluate the quality and performance of language model outputs. It also includes metadata about the pilot dataset used for evaluation.

Pilot Dataset Summary
Total Records: 289

Dataset Description: The pilot dataset consists of 289 evaluation records. Each record contains the original input prompt, the corresponding model-generated response, and human annotations or ground-truth references where applicable.

Use Case: The dataset has been designed to assess and monitor the performance of a language model when generating structured outputs, particularly in applications involving reasoning, summarization, or transformation of content.

Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are calculated for each record to provide comprehensive insights into model performance:

Accuracy

Definition: Measures how factually correct or logically valid the modelâ€™s response is with respect to the expected output.

Calculation Method: Human or LLM-generated comparison between ground truth and model output.

Completeness

Definition: Assesses whether the model's response includes all the essential components or required information from the input.

Calculation Method: Evaluated using a checklist or predefined expectation per prompt.

Hallucination

Definition: Identifies instances where the model generates information not supported or implied by the input data.

Calculation Method: Comparison with source input and domain-specific knowledge to flag unsupported claims.

Context Relevance

Definition: Measures how well the response aligns with the context or intent of the original prompt.

Calculation Method: Assessed based on relevance to the prompt and whether the output deviates from the expected contextual scope.

Semantic Relevance

Definition: Evaluates the degree to which the response preserves the intended meaning of the input while reformulating or structuring content.

Calculation Method: Computed via semantic similarity techniques or judgment-based scoring by evaluators or LLM judges.

This header section is intended to provide transparency into the methodology used for monitoring and ensure traceability of evaluation standards. Each metric is tracked per record and can be aggregated to identify trends, anomalies, or performance gaps.
