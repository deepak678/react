Objective:

To assess how closely the meaning of the response aligns with the intent of the request.

Methodology:

Single Prompt Evaluation: Uses one prompt where the LLM itself acts as a judge.

The prompt compares the semantic similarity between the request and the response.

Scoring Process:

The LLM provides a relevance score based on contextual and semantic alignment.

Focuses on capturing deep meaning beyond literal word matching.

Example Outcome:

Semantic Relevance Score: 92%

Visual Design Suggestion:

A diagram illustrating:

Request and Response → 2. LLM as Judge → 3. Semantic Relevance Score
