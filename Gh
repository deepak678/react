Enhance Admin Portal to Support New Request Types with Evaluation Metrics and Filtering

Epic Description
Extend the Admin Portal to support evaluation and management of new request types. This will include evaluating each request type against five predefined metrics, and enabling filtering of requests based on these new types to support better tracking, analysis, and decision-making.

Goals / Acceptance Criteria
Admin Portal supports evaluation for each new request type.

Each request is evaluated against the following five metrics:

Accuracy

Latency

Cost

Robustness

User Satisfaction

A new filter is added in the request listing page allowing admin users to filter requests by Request Type.

All new request types are stored, displayed, and evaluated consistently with existing data models and UI structures.

UI/UX should be consistent with the current portal design.

Request Types (examples – to be confirmed by product)
Model Evaluation

Content Moderation

Custom Query Testing

Regression Verification

User Prompt Review

User Stories (included in the epic)
As an admin, I want to see all incoming request types evaluated on 5 key metrics, so that I can analyze their performance comprehensively.

As an admin, I want to filter the request list by request type, so that I can easily narrow down requests based on evaluation needs.

As a developer, I want to update the backend schema and logic to handle new request types, so that they can be evaluated and filtered in the UI.

As a QA, I want to test that all request types are evaluated properly and filters work as expected, so that functionality remains reliable.

Dependencies
Backend schema and API updates to include new request types and evaluation metrics.

Frontend changes to display metrics and enable filters.

Coordination with model evaluation team for metric definition and logic.

Notes
Metrics should be modular and configurable, allowing addition or modification in the future.

Consider user roles – only admins may have access to evaluation view and filtering.

Let me know if you want this turned into smaller JIRA tickets or a Confluence-style version.
