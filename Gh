Okay, here are very short hover descriptions for each metric:

Accuracy: Is the information factually correct?

Completeness: Does it include all necessary information?

Hallucination: Is the information fabricated or unsupported?

Context Relevance: Is the response on-topic for the given prompt/situation?

Semantic Relevance: Does the response's meaning relate to the query's intent?
