Model monitoring is implemented through framework integration and adaptation.

The request–response lifecycle of ADA is fully integrated with the monitoring framework to enable end‑to‑end observability.

The data ingestion pipeline is adapted to support ADA‑specific data structures, making it both reliable and scalable.

This approach allows seamless data flow and ensures consistent metric generation across platforms.
