Hallucination (30%) — Highest Priority
Rationale: Hallucinations — outputs that are factually incorrect or fabricated — severely impact trust in generative models. Even a small number of hallucinated outputs can undermine the model's credibility.

Weight Justification: Given its critical importance in high-stakes or factual domains, we assign it the highest weight.

2. Accuracy (25%)
Rationale: Accuracy measures how well the output aligns with the expected or ground truth response. It reflects the correctness of reasoning and information delivery.

Weight Justification: Accuracy is vital but often closely related to hallucination. While hallucination focuses on false content, accuracy measures overall correctness, hence a slightly lower but still substantial weight.

3. Context Relevance (20%)
Rationale: Context relevance ensures that the model's response stays on-topic and is informed by the input prompt. A response might be accurate or fluent but completely off-topic — thus still unreliable.

Weight Justification: A relevant response is necessary for any meaningful interaction, making this metric essential, though secondary to factual correctness.

4. Completeness (15%)
Rationale: Completeness evaluates whether the response addresses all aspects of the prompt. It reflects the depth and thoroughness of the model’s understanding.

Weight Justification: While important, incomplete responses can sometimes be acceptable in lower-risk scenarios. Hence, it is assigned moderate weight.

5. Semantic Relevance (10%) — Lowest Priority
Rationale: Semantic relevance looks at how well the generated response semantically aligns with the intent or meaning of the input. This is more nuanced and overlaps with other metrics.

Weight Justification: Given the subtler nature of semantic alignment and partial overlap with context and accuracy, it receives the least weight in this version of the framework.
