3. Usage Controls
The ongoing monitoring plan must outline the model's usage details, including its users, frequency of use, and purpose. This section ensures transparency and accountability in the deployment of the RMC Risk Management Copilot.

3.1 Model Users
The primary users of the model are Risk Management Role Holders who interact with the system to transform unstructured issue descriptions into structured risk data artifacts.

These users operate within risk, audit, and compliance functions, leveraging the model’s outputs for documentation and reporting purposes.

The model’s structured outputs are stored in Helios, where they are accessed by risk teams for further review and validation.

3.2 Model Use Frequency
The model is used on an irregular basis, depending on individual user needs.

There is no fixed frequency of use—risk management role holders initiate model interactions based on their specific requirements for drafting risk-related documentation.

The system is available on demand, allowing users to generate structured outputs whenever necessary.

3.3 Purpose of Model Use
The RMC Risk Management Copilot is used to:

Obtain draft versions of risk data artifacts to aid in the creation of structured risk documentation.

Standardize issue descriptions into the 5C’s framework (Condition, Cause, Criteria, Consequence, Context).

Ensure completeness by identifying missing details and prompting for additional information when necessary.

Improve efficiency in risk assessment by structuring data in a clear and consistent format.

By defining clear usage controls, this monitoring plan ensures that the model is used consistently, responsibly, and in alignment with its intended purpose.
